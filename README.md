## Contributing

To contribute to an open-source repository on GitHub (or any other platform), you generally follow a common set of steps. A well-written `README.md` should clearly describe how others can contribute to the project. Here's a guide to creating a section in your `README.md` file that invites contributions:

### 1. **Create a Contribution Section in README**
In your repository’s README file, include a clear and inviting section about contributing. Here's an example format you can use:

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Follow the steps below to get started:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
Fork this repository to your own GitHub account. This creates your own copy of the project where you can make changes.

1. Go to the repository page.
2. Click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork
Once the repository is forked, clone your forked repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sangram03/75BlindLeetCode.git
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. This helps organize your work and makes it easier to review your changes.

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### Step 4: Make Your Changes
Make your changes to the codebase. Be sure to follow the project's coding standards and conventions (if applicable). Test your changes locally before committing them.

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Once your changes are ready, commit them with a clear and descriptive message. For example:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"
```

### Step 6: Push to Your Fork
Push your new branch with the committed changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Step 7: Open a Pull Request
Go back to the original repository and open a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into the main repository. Here’s how:

1. Navigate to the original repository.
2. Click on the **Pull Requests** tab.
3. Click the **New Pull Request** button.
4. Select your fork and branch as the source, and the main repository’s branch as the target.
5. Provide a detailed description of the changes and why they’re needed.

### Step 8: Code Review & Approval
One of the project maintainers will review your Pull Request. You might be asked to make some changes based on feedback. Once approved, your code will be merged into the main branch.
